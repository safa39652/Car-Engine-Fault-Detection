# ðŸ”Š Engine Fault Detection with Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project develops an **AI-powered engine fault detection system** based on **deep learning** and **audio signal analysis**.  
By analyzing recorded **engine sounds**, the system can automatically identify potential mechanical issues such as alternator pulley faults, belt problems, or abnormal vibrations.  

The main objectives are:  
- âœ… Support **preventive maintenance** by detecting anomalies early  
- âœ… Reduce **manual diagnostic time** for technicians  
- âœ… Provide a scalable solution that can be deployed via a **Flask API**  

The system is built around a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on an augmented dataset of engine audio recordings.  
This approach combines **signal processing techniques** with **machine learning** to achieve reliable classification of engine conditions.
